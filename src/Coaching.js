                                    <p>Tennis Xpress is a worldwide ITF program catering for beginner adults taking a ‘serve, rally, score’ approach to learning. The program is a fun, innovative way of teaching tennis which removes many of the barriers associated with learning the sport.<br /><br />
                                    Using low-pressure balls, and focusing on playing the game, adults build confidence as they receive simple technical and tactical advice adapted for each player’s needs.<br /><br />
                                    The aim is to get people playing the game quickly by using lower pressure balls, flexible court sizes, simple scoring and simple technical teaching, all which promote a successful learning environment where players gain confidence, skills, and have fun as they serve, rally and score!<br /><br />
                                    Another Fantastic program happening SOON at MCTC!
